## 1. Introduction

The Chemical Supplies Application is a web-based tool designed to manage and display information about various chemical supplies. It features a dynamic table with sorting capabilities, row manipulation options, and in-place editing functionality. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the application's design, implementation, and features.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Goals
- Create a user-friendly interface for managing chemical supply data
- Implement dynamic data manipulation features
- Ensure responsive design for various devices
- Develop a lightweight application without external frameworks

### 2.2 Target Audience
- Chemical supply managers

### 2.3 Key Requirements
- Display a table of chemical supplies with various attributes
- Allow sorting of data by different columns
- Implement row manipulation (add, delete, move)
- Enable in-place editing of data
- Ensure data persistence
- Develop as a Progressive Web App

## 3. Design Approach

The application follows a modular, object-oriented approach to ensure maintainability and scalability. The main components are:

### 3.1 Data Model
- JSON array storing chemical supply data
- Each entry contains: id, chemical name, vendor, density, viscosity, packaging, pack size, unit, and quantity

### 3.2 View
- Dynamic HTML table for displaying data
- Bootstrap-based responsive layout
- Custom CSS for enhanced styling

### 3.3 Controller
- JavaScript class (`chemical_app`) that handles all the functionality
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions

### 3.4 Design Principles
- Separation of concerns
- Single Responsibility Principle
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

## 4. Technology Stack

The application uses vanilla web technologies to keep it lightweight and framework-independent:

### 4.1 Frontend
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
  - Bootstrap 5.3.0 for basic components and grid system
  - Custom CSS for specific styling needs
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for functionality

### 4.2 PWA
- Service Worker for offline capabilities
- Web App Manifest for installability

### 4.3 Development Tools
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- GitHub Pages for static site hosting

## 5. Application Structure

The application consists of the following key files:

### 5.1 `index.html`
- Main HTML structure
- Includes table structure and toolbar buttons
- Links to CSS and JavaScript files

### 5.2 `stylesheet.css`
- Custom styles for the application
- Overrides and extensions of Bootstrap styles

### 5.3 `script.js`
- Contains the `chemical_app` class
- Implements all JavaScript functionality
- Handles data manipulation and UI updates

### 5.4 `manifest.json`
- Web app manifest for PWA support
- Defines app metadata, icons, and display properties

### 5.5 `service_worker.js`

## 6. Key Features

### 6.1 Dynamic Table Population
- Table is populated from JSON data on page load
- Each row represents a chemical supply entry

### 6.2 Sorting Functionality
- All columns are sortable in ascending order
- Clicking on column headers triggers sorting

### 6.3 Row Manipulation
- Add new rows with a form that appears at the bottom of the table
- Delete selected rows
- Move rows up or down within the table

### 6.4 In-place Editing
- clicking on numeric cells allows for in-place editing
- Changes are tracked and can be saved or discarded

### 6.5 Data Persistence
- Save functionality to persist changes
- Refresh option to revert to original data

### 6.6 Progressive Web App Capabilities
- Offline functionality
- Installable on devices

## 7. Code Design Choices

### 7.1 Object-Oriented Approach
The `chemical_app` class encapsulates all the functionality, promoting code organization and reusability. This approach allows for easy expansion of features and maintenance.

#### Key methods:
- `constructor(data, table_dom)`: Initializes the app with data and table DOM element
- `load_table()`: Populates the table with data
- `sort_rows(key)`: Sorts the table based on a given key
- `move(direction)`: Moves selected rows up or down
- `delete()`: Deletes selected rows
- `add_form()`: Adds a new row input form
- `save()`: Saves changes made to the table

### 7.2 Event-Driven Programming
Extensive use of event listeners for user interactions ensures a responsive and dynamic user interface.

Example:
```javascript
document.querySelector('#table_save').addEventListener('click', () => {
    app.save();
})
```

### 7.3 In-place Editing
Editing is implemented using contenteditable attributes and input elements, allowing for a seamless editing experience without the need for separate forms or modals.

### 7.4 Modular Functions
Each functionality (sort, move, delete, etc.) is implemented as a separate method within the `chemical_app` class, promoting code readability and maintainability.

### 7.5 Data Binding
Changes in the UI are reflected in the underlying data structure, ensuring consistency between the view and the model.

## 8. Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

The application is implemented as a PWA, providing a native app-like experience:

### 8.1 Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`)
- Defines the app's metadata for installation
- Specifies icons, theme colors, and display mode

Example:
```json
{
    "name": "Chemical_supplies_app",
    "short_name": "Chemical Supplies",
    "start_url": ".",
    "theme_color": "#212529",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "display": "standalone",
    "icons": [
        {
            "src": "images/logo192.jpg",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "images/logo512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 8.2 Service Worker (`service_worker.js`)
- Enables offline functionality and faster load times
- Caches static assets for offline use

Key features:
- Installation of service worker
- Caching of static assets
- Handling of fetch events to serve cached content when offline

Example:
```javascript
self.addEventListener("install", e => {
    e.waitUntil(
        caches.open("static").then(cache => {
            return cache.addAll(["./", './images/logo192.jpg']);
        })
    );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", e => {
    e.respondWith(
        caches.match(e.request).then(response => {
            return response || fetch(e.request);
        })
    );
});
```

## 9. Performance Considerations
